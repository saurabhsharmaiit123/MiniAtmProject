Implementation of ATM functionalities
The following is a mini project I created using C++ for an ATM. Using OOP concepts, we will implement ATM functionality in this mini-project. Checking the account balance is one of the functions. 2) Cash Withdraw: Users can withdraw cash from the ATM, but they must enter valid input, such as the amount to be withdrawn must be lower than the account balance. User Details: Users can view and cross-check their details with their financial institution. A user can update his or her mobile number that is associated with his bank account.
